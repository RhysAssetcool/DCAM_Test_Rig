## Running the Pumps

If you want to run the pumps, open another terminal, SSH into the test rig, navigate to the same `~/DCAM_Test_Rig` directory, and run:

```sh
python run_pumps.py
```

# DCAM Test Rig Control

This program provides a command-line interface to control a test rig using a joystick, motor controller, and DCAM (via CAN or serial). It uses Python's `argparse` module to allow flexible configuration via command-line arguments.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `pygame` (for joystick input)
- `pyserial` (for serial communication)
- `python-can` (for CAN bus communication)
- Appropriate permissions to bring up CAN interfaces (may require `sudo`)


## Usage

1. SSH into the test rig:

	```sh
	ssh <username>@<test_rig_ip>
	```

2. Navigate to the program directory:

	```sh
	cd ~/DCAM_Test_Rig
	```

3. Run the program from the command line:

	```sh

	# DCAM Test Rig Control

	## Overview
	This program provides a command-line interface to control a test rig using a joystick, motor controller, and DCAM (via CAN or serial). It is designed for flexible configuration and operation via command-line arguments.

	## Requirements
	- Python 3.8+
	- `pygame` (for joystick input)
	- `pyserial` (for serial communication)
	- `python-can` (for CAN bus communication)
	- Appropriate permissions to bring up CAN interfaces (may require `sudo`)

	---

	## Setup
	1. **SSH into the test rig:**
		```sh
		ssh <username>@<test_rig_ip>
		```
	2. **Navigate to the program directory:**
		```sh
		cd ~/DCAM_Test_Rig
		```
	3. **Dependencies:**
		The required Python packages are already installed on the test rig. You do not need to install them again.

	---

	## Usage
	Run the main control program with:
	```sh
	python Test_Rig_Control.py [OPTIONS]
	```

	### Example
	```sh
	python Test_Rig_Control.py \
	  --motor-port COM3 \
	  --dcam-can-channel can0 \
	  --x-axis-sensitivity 1.2 \
	  --y-axis-sensitivity 0.7 \
	  --z-axis-sensitivity 0.5 \
	  --acceleration 150 \
	  --max-speed 6000
	```

	## Running the Pumps

	If you want to run the pumps, open another terminal, SSH into the test rig, navigate to the same `~/DCAM_Test_Rig` directory, and run:

	```sh
	python run_pumps.py
	```

	---

	## Notes
	- Ensure your joystick is connected before running the program.
	- The program will print status and debug information to the console.
	- Use `Ctrl+C` to exit the program safely.

	---

	## Troubleshooting
	- If you see "No joystick connected", check your joystick connection and try again.
	- If serial or CAN initialization fails, ensure the correct port/channel and permissions.
